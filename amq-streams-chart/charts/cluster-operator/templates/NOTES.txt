Setup the cluster-operator for managing the kafka cluster.

Must be installed before the kafka components.

==== ClusterRoleBinding Renaming
Since we are deploying multiple amq streams clusters in a single Openshift cluster, 
I have changed the ClusterRoleBinding resources default name to add the namespace they are associated with.
This will allow the deployment of multiple instances of the same resource kind associated with different subjects.

Example: Look at amq-streams-chart/charts/cluster-operator/templates/021-ClusterRoleBinding-strimzi-cluster-operator.yaml
