# Installs the KafkaMirrorMaker2 instance which handles mirroring of strimzi-cluster from source-cluster to target-cluster

Since the replication takes place within the same cluster, we will use services for bootstrap-server hosts;
otherwise we would use instead routes for the source cluster and service for the target cluster.

==== Mirroring Strategy
If mirroring is being setup at the same time as the source kafka cluster, or historical data is not a concern:
    KafkaMirrorMaker2.spec.mirrors.sourceConnector.config.auto.offset.reset: latest
If replication of historical data is of concern, regardless of when MM2 was setup, set auto.offset.reset to earliest.
    KafkaMirrorMaker2.spec.mirrors.sourceConnector.config.auto.offset.reset: latest
